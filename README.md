# Garage door opener IoT project

This project is a simple IoT project that uses a Raspberry Pi to control a garage door opener. The Raspberry Pi is connected to a stepper motor and a rotary encoder. The stepper motor is used to open and close the garage door, while the rotary encoder is used for calibration and collision tracking.

- **Calibration:** The system can be calibrated to determine the open and closed positions of the garage door.
- **Error Detection:** The system can detect collisions or obstructions during the door's operation.

This project is a great way to learn about IoT, stepper motors, and rotary encoders. It can be expanded with additional features such as remote control via MQTT or a web interface.
